hi bambi

I've asked chatgpt to compile a small guide to the features of the app, here it is:

🌸 The "Treatment" Features
The app is built around a small "Fluo Bubblegum" interface, but underneath, it manages several conditioning vectors simultaneously:
1. Visual Interruption (The TRIGGER GIF Engine)
The core of the program. It monitors your screen and injects images from your assets folder at randomized intervals. (you can add your own gifs/images, but tons are alredy present)
Dual Monitor Support: It knows if you have two screens and will utilize both to ensure you can’t look away.
Multiplication: Sometimes, one image isn't enough. If you click on one it diasappears, but randomly on the screen 2 more random images get spowned :P
2. Subliminal Whispers
You might not even see them. The Subliminal Engine flashes text for as little as 1 frame (approx. 16ms).
The Vocabulary: Pre-loaded with phrases like "B***O D*LL," "S**P AND F***ET," and "BAMBI FR***E."
Customizable: You can inject your own triggers into the text pool (I alredy added the most common triggers). And choose for how long they are shown, and how often per minute.
3. The Startle Protocol (Mandatory Shorts)
This is the heavy hitter. At random intervals (customizable), the program initiates a Startle Event. (I pre loaded clips from some of the most rated videos from Hypnotube, featuring Overload, Makeup, Chastity Overload, TikToks, etc)
System Override: It pauses your music, ducks the volume of all other applications (Spotify, Discord, games), and forces a short video to the foreground.
Focus Lock: The video window fights for top-level status. You cannot ignore it.
Audio Ducking: It uses Windows WASAPI to lower the volume of everything else on your computer so the conditioning audio is the only thing you hear.
4. The "Attention" Game (Focus Check)
Being a Bambi isn't just about staring; it's about obedience.
The Targets: During a video, floating text targets (like "Z** C**K D***N O**Y" or "G*** G***") will drift across the screen.
Physics: They slide around your monitor. You have to click them.
The Penalty Loop: If you are too slow or too zoned out to click the targets, the program knows. It will loop the video and trigger a "Penalty Screen" mocking your intelligence until you get it right.  (3 times max then if you still didnt pass releases you)
5. Auditory Entrainment
The app serves as your DJ. It plays background drones or hypnosis files from the assets/backgrounds folder, managing the volume automatically so it never overpowers your main tasks—until a Startle Event happens.
⚠️ The "Deep End": Strict Lock & Stealth Mode
Read this section carefully. This app allows for "Self-Locking," and if you combine settings incorrectly (well or correctly😈), you will lose control of your computer until you hard-reboot. (and if you enabled run on startup you might get stuck till you pass the startle lock - or fai lit 3 times in a row)
The program includes features designed to simulate a total loss of control. Approach these with extreme caution.
1. The Cage (Strict Lock + Disable Panic)
In the System settings, you will find Strict Lock and Disable ESC.
Strict Lock: This removes the window close buttons. It intercepts and blocks Alt+F4, Tab, and Alt-Tab. If a video starts, you are stuck in that video until it finishes.
Disable ESC: By default, pressing ESC triggers a "Panic Stop" that kills the program instantly. Checking this box removes that safety net.
2. The Ghost (Start Minimized)
This hides the Control Panel entirely. There is no window on your taskbar. The only evidence the program is running is the occasional flash or video. And the tray icon ofc.
Start Minimized: if enabled the program launches quietly into the System Tray.
If you forced a short on start and disabled the esc button, well, sit tight bambi, you either pass the short attention check (if enabled) or you fail it and what the shot 3 times.
⛔ The Danger Combination (kinda, can be annoying if not wanted to please check your configs)
If you enable Strict Lock, Disable ESC, Minimize on start, and Run on Startup simultaneously:
Your PC will boot up with the program hidden.
You cannot see the Control Panel to stop it.
When a video triggers, you cannot close it (Alt+F4 is dead).
You cannot panic-quit (ESC is dead).
You cannot tab away (Alt-Tab is dead).
You are effectively locking yourself in a room and swallowing the key. The only way out of a short is a physical power button reset or hoping you can navigate to the System Tray icon in the few seconds between startles. Do not activate these settings unless you understand the consequences.
🧠 Final Note
The "Penalty Loop" logic is unforgiving. But still, to prevent the program to completely lock you out, i added a mercy counter, If you fail the attention check 3 times in a row, it triggers a Mercy Card (a giant screen calling you a "DUMB BAMBI") before resetting (and giving you some second to exit the program if you really really really got stuck). Don't say I didn't warn you.
Enjoy the pink fog. 🎀
